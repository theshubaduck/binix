IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR USERS:

Before you get started with Binix, you need to get yourself familiar with the command line. Here are some of the commands which will be useful if you are planning to create your own distro with this:

help. This displays all the available commands in the command line.
exit. Exits the Binix framework.
addservice <service_name>. This is where you add services to your distro, so on and so forth.
listservices. Lists every single service.
loadmodule <module_name>. It loads whatever module into the framework.
createfile <filename>. It creates a new file with whatever name you want.
deletefile <filename>. It deletes any file that you make.
listfiles. It lists all the files in the current directory.
runprocess <process_name>. It will run whatever process you want.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MAINTAINERS, DEVELOPERS, AND CONTRIBUTORS:

Please familiarize yourself with the license before you do anything. Plus, all contributions will go through GitHub instead of Git, so it is even more efficient compared to Linux. Also, please, for even more efficiency when you are directly changing the files, compress them back into ONE zip.

So, for having so many guidelines, however, it is better in this organized way. :) Efficiency is our ethos, and that goes the same for users. By doing this, you will help people download the Binix framework.

So, thank you personally :D.

Well, that's it from me. Happy coding!
